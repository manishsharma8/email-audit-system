# Email Audit

Email Audit is a system used to audit all emails sent from within an organization. In the event of security incidents (such as leakage of sensitive information via emails), this system will be used by the organization's auditing department to retrieve and verify the emails of the concerning parties through its admin console.

## Development

Install dependencies and then start in the development mode.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Navigate to the port that was displayed on the terminal. The app should be running after the development build is finished.

## Build

To generate production version:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can run the newly built app locally with `npm run preview`.
